## Project Goal and Description:
The community task force app utilizes four models of data, to allow users to create issue tickets for their city on community issues such as homelessness, poverty, unemployment, public infrastructure and also sign up to specific teams that are assigned to address these issues. The purpose is to allow for easier formation of community coalitions.

The four models. Cities -> Community Issues -> Taskforces -> Volunteers

## Future Directions, things not got to:
* In the future, I would like to prevent users from being able to submit data or edit data objects, if and of their data fields are      empty. 

* Create a scrollable div to showcase cities' image

* Create a how to use this app, and about page 

* Graphically show on the page the percentage of volunteers needed met by a task force in the form of a progress bar

* Explore many to many interactions between skills array that would be inserted into volunteers and taskforces
